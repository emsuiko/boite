      Boîte (fr. = box) is an webapp where you can collect links. It's not about saving links that you want to read later - there are great apps like pocket or readability for this already. It's about collecting links that you want to re-visit because they're so nice, beautiful, interesting or even sad - let's say: special - that you want to keep and save them to come back some time.

      I though about the many boxes that are on my parents attic with little snippets from my youth. Tickets, friendship books, shells from summer vacation, photos or poems from class. There are some nice things there connected with even more memories. When I am home visiting my parents I sometimes go up there and browse through these tokens.

      So, when browsing the depths of the net there are equally nice things I'd like to keep for later. But there's no nice box I can put them in. Well, here it is - a little digital box - Boîte.
